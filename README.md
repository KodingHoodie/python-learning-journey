# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Self-taught Python path starting February 2026.  
Currently working through Scrimba Learn Python + ZTM Python Automation Bootcamp.

### 📂 Repository Structure
- **[/scrimba](./scrimba)** → Exercises and mini-challenges from Scrimba.
- **[/ztm](./ztm)** → Notes, practice and projects from ZTM Python Automation Bootcamp.
- **[/my-upgrades](./my-upgrades)** → Taking course projects further. I include the original guided version alongside my own iterations, experimenting with different logic, cleaner structures to see which approach is most efficient.

Goal: Build real-world automation scripts (file operations, PDFs, emails, reporting).
